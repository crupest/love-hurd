# About Repos

## `hurd`

Contains all git repos from official Hurd project. You can get information from
Hurd at <https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/source_repositories.html>.

## `tools`

Contains additional tools needed to build Hurd and maintain repos.

### `tools/topgit`

Topgit upstream repo is at <https://github.com/greenrd/topgit>. However, it is
archived, so I download the last codes directly both to accelerate development
and to avoid the risk of deletion of upstream repo.
